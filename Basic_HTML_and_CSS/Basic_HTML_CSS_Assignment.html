			Here is a list of some of my favorite TV shows off the top of my head.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Breaking Bad</li>
			<li>The Wire</li>
			<li>It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia</li>
			<li>Scrubs</li>
			<li>Arrested Development</li>
			<li>The Office</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			These are all fantastic shows but I have recently been re-watching Breaking Bad and I must say, <span class="oomph">Gus Fring</span> is one of the best villains ever.
			Here is a ranking of my favorite foods as of right now.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Steak</li>
			<li>Pho</li>
			<li>Ramen</li>
			<li>Burritos</li>
			<li>Pizza</li>
			<li>Sushi</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Pho and ramen are very close for me. On some days, I might think pho &gt; ramen but on other days pho &lt; ramen.
